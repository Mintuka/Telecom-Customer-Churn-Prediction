The analysis of customer churn in the telecommunications industry demonstrates that churn is most common among
customers with shorter tenures, higher monthly charges, and month-to-month contracts. Key factors like total charges,
tenure, contract type, tech support, and online security significantly influence churn, with the absence of tech support and
online security correlating strongly with higher churn rates. Gender has minimal impact on churn, suggesting other factors
dominate customer decisions. Among the classification models used, Random Forest and Logistic Regression performed the
best in predicting churn, with Random Forest slightly outperforming in AUC while Logistic Regression better handled
false positives. The study underscores the need for retention strategies targeting high-risk customers early in their lifecycle,
especially those with flexible contracts and higher charges.
